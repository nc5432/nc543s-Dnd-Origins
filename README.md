This is a WIP origins datapack that aims to add the races and classes from the 5E dnd handbook to Minecraft. 
It currently is being made for Minecraft version 1.20.1, but I hope to support more versions in the future. 

Dependencies:
- Origins: https://modrinth.com/mod/origins/versions or https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-forge
- Origins: Classes: https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-classes or https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-classes-forge
- Pehkui: https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui
- (Soon) Weapon Master: https://modrinth.com/mod/weapon-master
- (Potentially) Armorer's Bane (if I can dynamically enable and disable for each player): https://modrinth.com/mod/armorers-bane
